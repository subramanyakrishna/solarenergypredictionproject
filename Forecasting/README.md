This repo consists of code, I used for creating  models on Solar Energy Prediction and Forecasting

For Prediction I experimented with svr,linear regression and random forest 

After a lot of research and Using feature Engineering and HyperParameter Tuning I was able to imporve the R2Score 
I used GradientBoostingRegressor and RandomSearchCV for HyperParameter Tuning 

Forecasting - Implement a Research-oriented topic,ie, using LSTM for forecasting
The model predicts future values of Solar Energy given the Present values
